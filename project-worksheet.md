## Project Overview

### Project Links

- [github repo](https://github.com/mzprizm/react-app-project)
- [add your deployment link]()

### Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

### API

Use this section to include info about the API you have chosen and a code snippet of the data that it returns and is required for your project.

{data: {} }
```


### Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

- [add link to your wireframes]()
- [add link to your react architecture]()


#### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP EXAMPLE
- Find and use external api 
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to interact with the page

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

- Add localStorage or firebase for storage

## Components
##### Writing out your components and its descriptions isn't a required part of the proposal but can be helpful.

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router| 
| Header | This will render the header include the nav | 
| Footer | This will render the header include the nav | 

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | 
| --- | :---: |  :---: | 
| prep | MVP | 10hrs|
| Working with API | MVP | 6hrs| 
| Building Components + Hooks | MVP | 10hrs| 
| Finishing up | MVP | 5hr | 
| Total |MVP | 31 hrs| 

### Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and thier role in the project such as Axios, ReactStrap, D3, etc. 

### Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description.  Code snippet should not be greater than 10 lines of code. 

```
